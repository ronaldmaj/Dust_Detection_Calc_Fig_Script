# Dust_Detection_Calc_Fig_Script

## Run the script file 'Dust_Paper_Revised_Script.m' in order to obtain the calculations and figures of the paper

This repository includes all the calculations and figures produced in the writing of the paper: 
Maj R. and Cairns I.H.  (2018) "Dust detection via voltage power spectroscopy on a CubeSat in Earth's ionosphere".

The script runs in MATLAB, prints out the calculations and produces MATLAB figures.
Not all calculated variables are printed out but these can be investigated as they should be saved to the working space.
The figures can be saved as .eps files by removing the '%' from the appropriate comment

Parameters can be changed in order to view how the resultant spectra will changes or how the minimum particle size is impacted.

If you have any questions, please contact me.
